# Audio
## Ear (input)
Need a driver from gstreamer audio pipeline to neural impulses

## Speech (Output)
Human rigid body approximation and diaphram actuation can be mapped to desired phoneme, pitch, and intensity. From there we just need an audio driver for playing a given phoneme, pitch, and intensity.

# Visual
## Sight
gstreamer visual pipeline to visual neural impulses

# Touch
Need to suround robotic approximation in a mesh for touch synthesis and conversion to neural impulses
