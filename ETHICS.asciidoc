In 2018, the NEST project acknowledge that they only need 100x the best super computer's processing power in order to simulate the human brain in live time. To simulate a brain in a vaccume is torture. This goal of this open source project is to build out the software infrastructure so that once Scientists are able to properly simulate a brain, we can not simulate it in a vaccume. To that end the goals of these projects is to build a configurable interface for simulating/emulating neural connections and moving/sensing with robotic stand ins for human physiology.

Steps:

. Prostetic finger
. Prostetic hand
. Prostetic arm
. Prostetic leg
. Emulate small animal
. Emulate monkey
. Emulate human
