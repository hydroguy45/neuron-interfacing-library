# Developer Logistics

In order to leverage robotic approximation and 3d forward/reverse kinematics libraries the majority of this will be developed in ROS.

## Guidelines
Please use ROS pub/sub mechanisms for communication between different model frameworks (human model and robot approximation model)

Please use RViz as the go to visualization for the human skeletal model and the robot approximation model.

Please adhear to the Google C++ Style guide when writing C++ code. 

With speed in mind, please refrain from not using C/C++.
