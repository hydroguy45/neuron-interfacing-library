# Robot Model

This is a representation of the state of the robot. The human model's skeletal state estimation is used as a control input to the robot model. The aim of the robot model is to minimize differences in position of corresponding joints in addition to minimizing deviation in end effector orientation.

Sensed input from the robot model can be propagated back to the human model which will produce corresponding neural inputs.

A special case exists for speech, but we will cross that bridge when we get there. The tldr; is as follows. Find orienation/position of mouth and tongue (harder because of lack of skeleton in tongue). Map diaphram changes to volumn. Map tongue position to phoneme. Play back as audio.
