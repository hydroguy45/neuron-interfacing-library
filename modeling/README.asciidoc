# Modeling

The justification of modeling is that there needs to be a determanistic way of determining how impulses should control the avatar and how input on the avatar should be mapped back to affect the human.

## Human Modeling

How we parse neural outputs into motion and how we convert sensed values back to neural inputs.

## Avatar Modeling

The model that we map to after establishing how the human model should change.

### Virtual

A virtual avatar is used to propagate neural outputs to a virtual manifestation. Sensed values are then propagated back to the neural input.

### Robotic

A robotic avatar is used to propagate neural outputs to a physical manifestation. Sensed values are then propagated back to the neural input.
